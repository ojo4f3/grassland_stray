# Grassland Stray: Shifting Savannas

## Description / Creative Brief
<p>This is a sidescrollig platform game with randomly generated levels. Help a lost cat return home.</p>
<p>This project started as a project in OSU's CS361 Software Engineering I course in 2023. I continue to work on this project with the goal of making it a more complete game. The game is a platform game with a cat character that avoids obstacles and tries to reach a new home. Each level is generated randomly from a set of levels based on difficulty.</p>
