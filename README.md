### Grassland Stray: Shifting Savannas

## Description / Creative Brief
<p>This project started as a project in OSU's CS361 Software Engineering I course. I decided to continue to work on this project and build it into a more complete game. The game is a platform game with a cat character that avoids obstacles and tries to reach a new home.</p>

## Roadmap
<p>The project is now complete for submission in class. The next element I would like to add would be sound and more animations. Eventually I would like to have many more scenes, enemies, loot, and a high score system.</p>
